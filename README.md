#Featured Projects
[Paper Trading Web App](https://github.com/AndrewChan8/stock-paper-trading.git)
Developed a browser-based paper trading platform in a team of four over a
10-week period. Served as the backend developer, building RESTful APIs
in Node.js to connect a React frontend with a PostgreSQL database.
Implemented simulated buy/sell functionality and real-time stock tracking
using virtual currency.

[Decision Tree vs. Multilayer Perceptron Research Paper](https://github.com/MilesAnderson/ml-calorie-regression.git)
Implemented Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron regression models
in Python to predict calorie expenditure using wearable sensor and
demographic features. Performed extensive hyperparameter tuning with
GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation, evaluated models using MAE
and RMSLE, and analyzed learning curves, feature importance, and
training/inference time on a 750k-sample dataset.
